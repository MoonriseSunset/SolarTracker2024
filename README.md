## Folder Layout:

### CAD:
This folder has all of the 3d model files, the model which is currently in use is ``CURRENT CASE.3mf``. You can safely ignore the others for now.

### Software:

#### Arduino:
This folder has the ``.ino`` versions of the main code which can be directly imported into the *Arduino IDE*.

#### In-Class Code, Main Code, and PhotoresistorTesting:
These are all project folders for the software I'm using to write code, said software is called *PlatformIO* and it's an extension for VSCode. It lets me write code on different computers without having to worry about tweaking settings every time.
